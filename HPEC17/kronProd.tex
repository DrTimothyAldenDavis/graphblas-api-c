 \section{Kronecker Product}
\label{Chp:Extensions}
One of the proposed operations in the mathematical specification of GraphBLAS is Kronecker product. It is not present in the current GraphBLAS API, but may be added in the future. Kronecker product may be useful for generating graphs. It is known that the Kronecker product of the adjacency matrices of two graphs is the adjacency matrix of their tensor product graph.
