\section{Standard Definitions}
\label{Sec:stddef}

The current GraphBLAS specification could be augmented with a list of 
pre-defined objects, such as descriptors, semirings and monoids, that are commonly used
in building graph algorithms. These standard pre-defined objects would
simplify coding and ensure more consistency across algorithms. 
We emphasize
that individual application writers are always free to create their own set of
pre-defined objects.

Additionally, GraphBLAS could include pre-defined macros that support
shorter calling syntax for methods, by hiding default arguments. 
Again, individual application writers are always free to create their
own set of pre-defined objects.

We propose that such pre-defined objects and macros would
be included in a compilation unit through a construct like:

\begin{verbatim}
#include "GrB_stddef.h"
\end{verbatim}
