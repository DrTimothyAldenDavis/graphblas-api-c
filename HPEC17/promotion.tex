\emph{Rank promotion} is the conversion of an object of lower rank (\eg,
scalar or rank 0) to an object of a higher rank (\eg, vector or rank 1).
It is a common feature in array programming languages suchs as Fortran~90+
and MATLAB.  Typically, a scalar is converted to a matrix or vector
by replicating it in every element of the matrix or vector. A vector is
conveterd to a matrix by replicating it either along the rows or along the
columns of the matrix.  The replication factor can be stated explicitly
or implicitly calculated in order to result in a valid operation.

In GraphBLAS, scalars, whether of built-in or user-defined type, are
always of rank 0. Vectors and matrices are of rank 1 and 2, respectively.
Our proposal is to support \emph{automatic} rank promotion by allowing,
in most cases, the use of an object of lower rank in an input argument.

For example, in the GraphBLAS matrix multiply method 
\begin{quote} 
{\sf GrB\_mxm(C,Mask,accum,op,A,B,desc)}
\end{quote}
{\sf A} and {\sf B} are input matrices. One could replace either (or both)
of them by a scalar or vector.  Assume no tranposition specified by the
descriptor {\sf desc}, and let {\sf C} be an $m \times n$ matrix, {\sf A}
be a scalar and {\sf B} be an $p \times n$ matrix. The scalar {\sf A}
would be converted into an $m \times p$ matrix, with all its elements
set to the value of {\sf A}.  After that, the matrix multiplication would
proceed as specified in the standard.  We note that the same requirements
for domain compatibility would still hold.

If, instead, {\sf A} were an $m$-element vector, it would be converted into
an $m \times p$ matrix by replicating it $p$ times as a column of the matrix.
Replication as rows could be achieved by specifying transposition of
{\sf A} in the descriptor.

A tentative list of GraphBLAS methods supporting automatic rank
promotion is shown in Table~\ref{Tab:Promotions}. We should note that 
rank promotion can already be accomplished explicitly with the existing
GraphBLAS methods. However, doing it automatically, as we propose,
saves a matrix or vector instantiation just for that purpose.
