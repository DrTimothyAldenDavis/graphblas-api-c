\section{Generalized User-Defined Types}
\label{Sec:UsrTypes}

Currently, GraphBLAS only supports a limited form of user-defined types. In particular, objects of the
data type must have a flat memory representation, so that two objects can be copied with a simple {\tt memcpy} operation. 
It is desirable to lift this restriction. One possibility would be to add a version of {\sf GrB\_Type\_new} that supports
arbitrary user-defined types as follows.

%\paragraph{\syntax}
%
% TGM: I'm having problems with the Verbatim package
%\begin{verbatim}
%        GrB_Info GrB_Type_new(GrB_Type   *utype,
%                              void       *create,
%                              void       *destroy,
%                             void       *copy);
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\paragraph{Parameters}
%
%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.1in]
%\item[{\sf utype}] ({\sf INOUT}) On successful return, contains a handle to the newly created user-defined GraphBLAS type object.
%\item[{\sf create}] ({\sf IN})    A pointer to a function that creates and initializes (to a default state) an object of the user-defined type. Such function must return a {\tt void*} pointer to the new object.
%\item[{\sf destroy}] ({\sf IN}) A pointer to a function that destroys an object of the user-defined type, releasing any resources the object uses.
%\item[{\sf copy}] ({\sf IN}) A pointer to a function that copies the contents from a source object of the user-defined type to a destination object of the same user-defined type.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\paragraph{Return Values}
%
%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
%\%item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]           operation completed successfully.
%\item[{\sf GrB\_PANIC}]             unknown internal error.
%\item[{\sf GrB\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY}]          not enough memory available for operation.
%\item[{\sf GrB\_NULL\_POINTER}]    at least one of {\sf utype}, {\sf create}, {\sf destroy}, {\sf copy} pointers is {\sf NULL}.
%\end{itemize}
