\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The GraphBLAS C API 1.0 provisional specification was released in May of 2017.  The qualifier ``provisional'' will be dropped once
two conformant implementations of the specification have been completed.  To manage the scope of the project,
we had to defer many planned features for a future release of the GraphBLAS C API.  

A successful API evolves over time to meet the needs of its user community.   This means a dialog
between the users of the API and the team working on the API is critical.  This paper is the start of the next
phase in that dialog; to launch the ongoing discussion of the future GraphBLAS C API version 2.0.
