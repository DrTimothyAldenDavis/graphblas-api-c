\section{Dependency DAGs and {\sf wait} on Specific Objects}
\label{Sec:DAG}

In the current specification of GraphBLAS, when operating in \emph{nonblocking
mode}, the operation {\sf wait} will ensure that the current sequence of
GraphBLAS operations has either completed, or encountered some
error. Further, a sequence in nonblocking mode where every GraphBLAS
operation is followed by an {\sf wait} call is equivalent to the same
sequence in blocking mode with {\sf wait} calls removed.

It may be desirable to modify the {\sf wait} interface such that it
takes a GraphBLAS object as parameter, and performs all
outstanding computations needed to compute that particular object.
This approach gives the programmer finer grained specification of the synchronization,
while giving the GraphBLAS implementation more flexibility in scheduling operations.

We decided to defer such an interface from version 1.0 of the GraphBLAS
specification. We believe that additional experience with implementing and
using GraphBLAS nonblocking mode is necessary before we
can determine what is the best approach.
