\subsection{{\sf free}: Destroy object}

Destroys a previously created GraphBLAS object and releases any resources associated with the object.

\paragraph{\syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
        GrB_Info GrB_free(GrB_Object *obj);
\end{verbatim}


\paragraph{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.1in]
	\item[{\sf obj}] ({\sf INOUT}) An existing GraphBLAS object to be destroyed. 
    Can be a GraphBLAS matrix, vector, descriptor, semiring, monoid, binary op, 
		unary op, or type. On successful completion of {\sf GrB\_free}, {\sf obj} behaves as an initialized object.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Return Values}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
\item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]        operation completed successfully
\item[{\sf GrB\_PANIC}]          unknown internal error
\item[{\sf GrB\_UNINITIALIZED\_OBJECT}]       object has not been initialized by a call 
                                 to the respective {\sf *\_new} method.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Description}

GraphBLAS objects consume resources, such as memory,  
managed by the runtime system on behalf of the object.  A call to {\sf GrB\_free()}
frees those resources so they are available for use by other GraphBLAS objects.
Calling {\sf GrB\_free} with an invalid object is legal and causes the system
to try to free the resouces associated with that object.
