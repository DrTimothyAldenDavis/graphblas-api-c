\section{Context Methods}

The methods in this section sets up and tears down the GraphBLAS
context within which all GraphBLAS methods must occur.  The initialization
of this context also includes the specification of which execution mode is
to be used.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\sf init}: Initialize a GraphBLAS context}

Creates and initializes a GraphBLAS C API context.  The argument
to {\sf GrB\_init} defines the mode for the context.  The two
available modes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\sf GrB\_BLOCKING}: Methods in a sequence return after
computations in the method have completed and output arguments
are available to subsequent statements in an application.  When
executing in {\sf GrB\_BLOCKING} mode, the methods execute 
in program order.

\item {\sf GrB\_NONBLOCKING}: Methods in a sequence return after
arguments in the method have been tested for consistency with the
method but potentially before computations complete or output 
arguments are available to subsequent statements in an application.
When executing in {\sf GrB\_NONBLOCKING} mode, the methods 
in a sequence may execute in any order that preserves the 
mathematically result defined by the squence.

\end{itemize}

{\sf GrB\_init()} may be called with {\sf GrB\_NULL} to select 
the default mode.  This mode is implementation defined.

\paragraph{\syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
        GrB_Info GrB_init(GrB_Mode mode);
\end{verbatim}


\paragraph{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.1in]
	\item[{\sf mode}] Mode for the GraphBLAS context.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Return Values}

\scott{Need an error for when init() is called a second time or after finalize. Or if finalize is called without init}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
\item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]           operation completed successfully
\item[{\sf GrB\_PANIC}]             unknown internal error  
\item[{\sf GrB\_INVALID\_VALUE}]    invalid mode specified
\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{{\sf finalize}: Finalize a GraphBLAS context}

Terminates and frees any internal resources created to 
support the GraphBLAS C API context.
An application may not create a new context after 
{\sf GrB\_finalize} has been called.

\paragraph{\syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
        GrB_Info GrB_finalize();
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Return Values}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
\item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]        operation completed successfully
\item[{\sf GrB\_PANIC}]          unknown internal error
\end{itemize}
