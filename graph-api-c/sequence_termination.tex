\subsection{{\sf wait}: Waits until pending operations complete}
\label{Sec:wait}

When running in non-blocking mode, this function guarantees that all pending GraphBLAS operations are fully executed.  Note that this can be called in blocking mode without an error, but there should be no pending GraphBLAS operations to complete.

\paragraph{\syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
        GrB_Info GrB_wait()
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Parameters}

\paragraph{Return values}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
	\item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]	operation completed successfully.
	\item[{\sf GrB\_INDEX\_OUT\_OF\_BOUNDS}]	an index out-of-bounds execution error happend during completion of pending operations.
	\item[{\sf GrB\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY}]		and out-of-memory execution error happened during completion of pending operations.
	\item[{\sf GrB\_PANIC}]		unknown internal error.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Description}

Upon successful return, all previously called GraphBLAS methods have
fully completed their execution, and  any (transparent or opaque) data
structures produced or manipulated by those methods can be safely touched.
If an error occured in any pending GraphBLAS operations, {\sf GrB\_error()}
can be used to retrieve implementation defined
error information about the problem encountered.

        GrB_Info GrB_wait(GrB_Matrix A)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.1in]
        \item[{\sf A}]   ({\sf IN})     An existing GraphBLAS matrix.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Return values}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
\item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]	operation completed successfully.
\item[{\sf GrB\_PANIC}]		unknown internal error; 
\item[{\sf GrB\_UNINITIALIZED\_OBJECT}]  matrix has not been initialized by a
                            call to {\sf new}.

\paragraph{Description}

Upon return, all previously called GraphBLAS methods that used {\sf A} either as 
input or output have fully completed their execution.
Any (transparent or opaque) data structures produced or manipulated by those 
methods can be safely touched.
