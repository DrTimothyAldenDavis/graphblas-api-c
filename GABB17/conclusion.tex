\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The GraphBLAS forum started its work on standard building blocks for 
graphs in the language of linear algebra in 2013~\cite{hpec13}.  A few
years later, we released the mathematical
definition of the GraphBLAS~\cite{mathgraphblas16}.
In this paper, we report on the first effort to define a language binding
to the GraphBLAS; the GraphBLAS C API.

With the specification complete, work is now underway to create 
reference implementations of the API.  
After reference implementations are complete and we validate
the core GraphBLAS C API, work will shift to optimizing
GraphBLAS C libraries and benchmarking against more established
frameworks for graph algorithms.
