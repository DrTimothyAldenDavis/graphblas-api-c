The GraphBLAS standard defines a set of matrix and vector operations 
over semiring algebraic structures.  These operations can be used
to express a wide range of graph algorithms.  

The GraphBLAS C API is built on a collection of objects exposed to 
the C programmer as opaque data types. Functions that manipulate these
objects are referred to as {\it methods}.  These methods fully define the 
interface to GraphBLAS objects to create or destroy them, modify their 
contents, and copy the contents of opaque objects into non-opaque objects the 
contents of which are under direct control of the programmer.
