The BC code in Figure~\ref{Fig:BClisting} 
was tested using the GraphBLAS Template Library (GBTL)\cite{gbtl-cuda16}. This 
C++ library is functionally equivalent to the the GraphBLAS C
API with similar signatures.  The latest development snapshot, 
including the working BC implementation, is available~\cite{gbtl-github}. 

Work is in progress to integrate the GraphBLAS C API 
with Gunrock~\cite{topc17}, a highly optimized backend for execution 
on GPU backends.  Another project~\cite{cook} implemented a variation
of the GraphBLAS C API using standard C99.
Efforts are underway to add a GraphBLAS C interface to GPI~\cite{gpi2016}.
Last, a GraphBLAS library in Chapel is under development~\cite{chiuw17}.
