The subroutine in Figure~\ref{Fig:BClisting} was implemented using the
the GraphBLAS Template Library (GBTL)\cite{gbtl-cuda16}. This is a C++ library whose
goal is to implement functionally equivalent operations as the GraphBLAS C
Specification with similar signatures.  As of the writing of this paper, it is 
under active development as the specification approaches 
completion.  The latest development snapshot, including the working BC 
implementation and its unit test code, can be found on github \cite{gbtl-github}.
