The subroutine in Figure~\ref{Fig:BClisting} was implemented using
the GraphBLAS Template Library (GBTL)\cite{gbtl-cuda16}. This is
a C++ library whose goal is to implement functionally equivalent
operations as the GraphBLAS C API and with similar signatures.
As of the writing of this paper, it is under active development as the
specification approaches completion.  The latest development snapshot,
including the working BC implementation and its unit test code, can be
found on GitHub \cite{gbtl-github}. Efforts are also under way
to give GPI~\cite{gpi2016} a GraphBLAS C API interface.

Development is also being done integrating GraphBLAS with low-level
optimized backends on graphic processing units (GPUs). On GPUs which are
known to be difficult to optimize, one candidate for a high performance
backend is Gunrock\cite{topc17}.
