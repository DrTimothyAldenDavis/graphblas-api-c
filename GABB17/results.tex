The BC code in Figure~\ref{Fig:BClisting} 
was tested using the GraphBLAS Template Library (GBTL)\cite{gbtl-cuda16}. This 
C++ library is functionally equivalent to the the GraphBLAS C
specification with similar signatures.  The latest development snapshot, 
including the working BC implementation, is available~\cite{gbtl-github}. 

Work is in progress to integrate the GraphBLAS C specification 
with Gunrock\cite{topc17}, a highly optimized backend for execution 
on GPUs backends.  A second project~\cite{cook} implemented a variation
of the  GraphBLAS C specification using standard C'99.
Efforts are also under way
to give GPI~\cite{gpi2016} a GraphBLAS C API interface.
